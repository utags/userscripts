- **Quick Access**: Access the cached list from any topic page via:
  - A floating button in the bottom-right corner
  - Customizable keyboard shortcuts (default: Alt+Q for topic list)
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Navigate between topics using:
  - Customizable keyboard shortcuts (default: Alt+W for next, Alt+E for previous)

## How It Works

This script operates entirely on the client-side with a focus on efficiency and minimal resource usage:

1. **Client-Side Caching**: When you visit a topic list page, the script captures the HTML content of the topic list and stores it in your browser's local storage.

2. **Zero Additional Server Requests**: The script works with content that's already been loaded by your browser, creating no additional load on the Discourse server.

3. **SPA Navigation**: The script leverages Discourse's Single Page Application architecture to navigate between topics without full page reloads, making navigation nearly instantaneous.

4. **DOM Manipulation**: The cached topic list is displayed through careful DOM manipulation, creating a seamless overlay that matches your forum's current theme.

5. **Event-Based Interaction**: All user interactions (keyboard shortcuts, button clicks) are handled through efficient event listeners.

The design philosophy prioritizes performance and server friendliness - the script adds convenient navigation without generating any additional server requests beyond what Discourse normally requires.

## Limitations

Due to the caching mechanism used by the script, there are some limitations:

1. **Non-Real-Time Data**: The reply counts and view counts displayed in the cached topic list are not real-time data, but rather the data at the time of caching.

2. **Cache Freshness**: The topic list is only updated when you visit a list page. If you haven't visited a list page for a long time, the cached data may differ significantly from the actual situation.

3. **New Topics Not Automatically Displayed**: New topics posted after you cached the list won't appear in the quick switcher until you visit the list page again to refresh the cache.

4. **Limited Topic Count**: The quick switcher can only display topics included in the last list page you visited, typically one page worth of content.

These limitations are design choices made to maintain the script's lightweight nature and zero additional server request advantage.
