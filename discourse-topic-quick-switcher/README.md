# Discourse Topic Quick Switcher

A powerful user script that brings seamless topic navigation, intelligent current topic highlighting, and adaptive theme switching to Discourse forums. Browse your favorite forums with unprecedented speed and efficiency.

## Features

- **Topic List Caching**: Automatically caches the topic list when you visit a list page.
- **Quick Access**: Access the cached list from any topic page via:
  - A floating button in the bottom-right corner
  - A keyboard shortcut (backtick key `` ` ``)
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Displays cache time and source information
  - Navigate directly to topics from the popup panel
  - Close with the ESC key, a close button, or by clicking outside the panel
  - Highlights the current topic for easy identification
  - Automatically scrolls to the current topic in the list
- **Smart Theme Detection**:
  - Automatically adapts to light/dark mode based on system and site preferences
- **Cache Management**:
  - 1-hour cache expiration with a visual indicator
  - Source link to return to the original list page

## How It Works

This script operates entirely on the client-side with a focus on efficiency and minimal resource usage:

1. **Client-Side Caching**: When you visit a topic list page, the script captures the HTML content of the topic list and stores it in your browser's local storage.

2. **Zero Additional Server Requests**: The script works with content that's already been loaded by your browser, creating no additional load on the Discourse server.

3. **SPA Navigation**: The script leverages Discourse's Single Page Application architecture to navigate between topics without full page reloads, making navigation nearly instantaneous.

4. **DOM Manipulation**: The cached topic list is displayed through careful DOM manipulation, creating a seamless overlay that matches your forum's current theme.

5. **Event-Based Interaction**: All user interactions (keyboard shortcuts, button clicks) are handled through efficient event listeners.

The design philosophy prioritizes performance and server friendliness - the script adds convenient navigation without generating any additional server requests beyond what Discourse normally requires.

## Limitations

Due to the caching mechanism used by the script, there are some limitations:

1. **Non-Real-Time Data**: The reply counts and view counts displayed in the cached topic list are not real-time data, but rather the data at the time of caching.

2. **Cache Freshness**: The topic list is only updated when you visit a list page. If you haven't visited a list page for a long time, the cached data may differ significantly from the actual situation.

3. **New Topics Not Automatically Displayed**: New topics posted after you cached the list won't appear in the quick switcher until you visit the list page again to refresh the cache.

4. **Limited Topic Count**: The quick switcher can only display topics included in the last list page you visited, typically one page worth of content.

These limitations are design choices made to maintain the script's lightweight nature and zero additional server request advantage.
